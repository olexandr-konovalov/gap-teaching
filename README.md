# A collection of GAP Jupyter notebooks 

This is a collection of GAP Jupyter notebooks. It uses the Docker
container with the latest public release of GAP, which is maintained in
a separate repository at <https://github.com/gap-system/gap-docker>, in
order to allow to run these notebooks on Binder (<https://mybinder.org/>).

To launch these notebooks in an executable environment on Binder, perform
the following steps:

1. Click on the "launch binder" badge in this README file on GitHub, or open
<https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/olexandr-konovalov/gap-teaching/master> in the browser.

2. First "Loading repository: olexandr-konovalov/gap-teaching/master" will be 
displayed, followed by a non-interactive preview. When the environment
will be ready, you will see the main Jupyter screen with a list of files.

3. Click on any `.ipynb` file to open it. This will start GAP Jupyter notebook.
You should be able to run the code in the notebook, e.g. by executing one cell
after another, or by running all cells, and perform other actions, e.g. add
new cells to the notebook, or start a new notebook. Your changes will not be
preserved after the window will be closed, but you should be able to download
the notebook in various formats. For further information about Jupyter, see 
<https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>.

Note that GitHub renders Jupyter notebooks in a human readable form, see e.g.
<https://github.com/olexandr-konovalov/gap-teaching/blob/master/notebooks/TipsAndPitfalls.ipynb>.
